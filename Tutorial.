***How To Use - By Alex Houghton***
First Copy the script into Console (by Ctrl Shift I) at Dashboard page at (https://dashboard.blooket.com/my-sets) before hosting, then do it again when game code is on screen
Do it once again after everyone joins (instead of pasting into console copy the script and ask chatgpt or blackbox.ai to transfer this code into a bookmarklet)
Then when you start the game if anyone using cheats or hacks via bookamrk (all hacks do) the bookmark will get deleted or the blooket account will get flagged/reported to Blooket.
